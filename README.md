# Django-Shop_Dashboard_App
Start a django server and open localhost in a browser.

Shops can be added only on the admin panel but orders for any shop can be added once logged in with user id.

To create a shop, the shop must be integrated with an owner who has to be an existing user.

Users who have integrated shops can only access the dashboard.

**Superuser - admin : adminpassword**
